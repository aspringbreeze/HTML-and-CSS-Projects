# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
I just began to learn HTML and CSS. This repository is filled with the HTML and CSS Projects I did in the HTML AND CSS COURSE of the Tech Academy boot camp.

## Projects

This page is an example home page for a space travel company. It's styled with CSS and contains navbar, fancy images and a contact form.
